# üëê Create a vector search index

To retrieve documents from MongoDB using vector search, you must configure a vector search index on the collection into which you ingested your data. The recommended way to do this is via the MongoDB drivers.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 6: Create a vector search index** section in the notebook to create a vector search index.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_8**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
collection.create_search_index(model=model)
```
<InfoButton title="Creating a Search Index" message={`This code creates a search index on the collection. Let's break it down:

- collection: This is the collection object you created earlier
- create_search_index(): This is a method of the collection object that takes a model and creates a search index on the collection

For example, if you had this collection:

\`\`\`python
collection = mongodb_client["mongodb_genai_devday"]["knowledge_base"]
\`\`\`

The code would create a search index on the collection.

\`\`\`python
<pymongo.collection.Collection object at 0x1234567890>
\`\`\`

This is the collection object that you can use to create a search index on the collection.

`} />

To verify that the index was created, navigate to the **Overview** page in the Atlas UI. In the **Clusters section**, select your cluster and click **Browse collections**.

Navigate to **Search Indexes** for the _knowledge_base_ collection in the _mongodb_genai_devday_ database.

The index is ready to use once the status changes from **PENDING** to **READY**.
