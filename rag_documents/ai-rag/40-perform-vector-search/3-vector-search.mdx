# üëê Perform vector search queries

Now let's run some vector search queries against the data present in MongoDB. 

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 7: Perform vector search on your data** section in the notebook to run vector search queries against your data.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_9**

<div>
```python
get_embedding(user_query)
```
<InfoButton title="Embedding Query" message={`This code takes a user query and returns a list of embedding vectors. Let's break it down:

- get_embedding(): This is a function you've defined that takes a piece of text and returns a list of embedding vectors
- user_query: This is the query you want to embed

For example, if you had this query:

\`\`\`python
user_query = "What is MongoDB Atlas?"
\`\`\`

The get_embedding() function would return a list of embedding vectors for the query.

\`\`\`python
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
\`\`\`

This list of vectors can then be used for vector search on the data.

<InfoButton title="Vector Search Pipeline" message={`This code performs a vector search on the data. Let's break it down:

- "$vectorSearch": This is the vector search operator
- "index": This is the name of the search index you want to use
- "queryVector": This is the query vector you want to use
- "path": This is the path to the field you want to search on
- "numCandidates": This is the number of candidates to consider for the search
- "limit": This is the number of results to return

For example, if you had this pipeline:

\`\`\`python
pipeline = [

        "$vectorSearch": {
            "index": ATLAS_VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME,

The pipeline would perform a vector search on the data and return the results.

```python
collection.aggregate(pipeline)

<InfoButton title="Performing Vector Search" message={`This code performs a vector search on the data. Let's break it down:

- collection: This is the collection object you created earlier
- aggregate(): This is a method of the collection object that takes a pipeline and performs a vector search on the data

For example, if you had this pipeline:

\`\`\`python
pipeline = [
