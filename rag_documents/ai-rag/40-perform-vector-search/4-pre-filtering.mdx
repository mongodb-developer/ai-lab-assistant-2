# ü¶π Combine pre-filtering with vector search

Pre-filtering is a technique to optimize vector search by only considering documents that match certain criteria during vector search.

In this section, you will learn how to combine filters with vector search. This mainly involves:
* Updating the vector search index to include the appropriate filter fields
* Updating the `$vectorSearch` stage in the aggregation pipeline definition to include the filters

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Combine pre-filtering with vector search** section in the notebook to experiment with combining pre-filters with your vector search queries.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

<InfoButton title="Creating a Search Index" message={`This code creates a search index on the collection. Let's break it down:

- collection: This is the collection object you created earlier
- create_search_index(): This is a method of the collection object that takes a model and creates a search index on the collection

For example, if you had this collection:

\`\`\`python
collection = mongodb_client["mongodb_genai_devday"]["knowledge_base"]
\`\`\`

The code would create a search index on the collection.

\`\`\`python
<pymongo.collection.Collection object at 0x1234567890>
\`\`\`

This is the collection object that you can use to create a search index on the collection.
