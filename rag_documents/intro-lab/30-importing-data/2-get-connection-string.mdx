# üëê Get your connection string

In order to load the dataset into your cluster, you will need to get the connection string for your cluster.

In the Atlas UI, navigate to the **Overview** page. In the **Clusters section**, click **Connect**.

A modal will display several ways to connect to your database.

Select **Compass**. While we won't be using Compass to import the data, it's an easy way to see your connection string.

Look for your connection string. It should look something like

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/
```

Click the copy button next to your connection string to copy it to your clipboard. Paste the connection string somewhere safe. You will need this connection string several times throughout this training.

:::tip
Don't forget to replace `<password>` with the password you set when you created the cluster.
