# ðŸ“˜ The Library Management System Application

Throughout this workshop, you will have the opportunity to interface with the data using the library management system application we've provided you. This application uses an Angular front-end and a Node.js back-end. The application is already built and deployed to a Github Codespace, so you won't need to install anything in your local environment. You will be able to access the application from your browser.

Our library management application leverages the data modeling patterns you'll explore throughout this workshop. As you navigate through the application, you'll witness how these patterns come to life, enhancing both the user experience and the efficiency of the system.

Our library application enables users to explore a rich catalog of books, search for specific titles, delve into book details, and even share their thoughts through comments. Users can also reserve books for future reading. Behind the scenes, MongoDB's data modeling patterns play a crucial role in ensuring the application's flexibility, scalability, and performance.

For library employees, an admin panel offers functionalities like managing book checkouts and returns. As we guide you through the application, you'll discover how the various design patterns we've discussed so far are seamlessly integrated to optimize data storage, retrieval, and overall system performance.

Let's get you set up with this application now.
