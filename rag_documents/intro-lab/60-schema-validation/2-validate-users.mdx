#  üëê Enable validation for the users collection

In this exercise, you will explore the pre-written JSON validation schema for the `users` collection, run a script to apply it to the collection, and test the schema validation by inserting a document that does not match the schema.

## Database User Permissions

To update the validator for any database collection, your database user must have admin privileges. Follow these steps to ensure your user has the correct permissions:

1. Open the [Atlas UI](https://cloud.mongodb.com?utm_campaign=devrel&utm_source=workshop&utm_medium=cta&utm_content=developer.day&utm_term=project.phoenix).
2. In the left-hand menu, navigate to **Network Settings** and select **Database Access**.
3. Locate your database user in the list. Check the **MongoDB Roles** column for the role of the user you are using for this workshop. If the role is not **atlasAdmin@admin**, you will need to update it.
4. If the role is not **atlasAdmin@admin**, click the **Edit** button next to the user.
5. Scroll down to the **Database User Privileges** section and expand the **Built-in Role** dropdown.
6. Select **Atlas admin** from the dropdown menu.
7. Click **Update User** to save the changes.

Atlas will deploy the change in a few seconds.


## Explore the JSON Schema

The JSON schema for the `users` collection is stored in the `server/src/schema-validation/apply-schema.ts` [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/main/server/src/schema-validation/apply-schema.ts). Open the file in your GitHub Codespace and examine the schema.

```js
const userSchema = {
    bsonType: 'object',
    required: ['name', 'isAdmin'],
    properties: {
        name: {
            bsonType: 'string',
            minLength: 5,
            description: 'must be a string and is required'
        },
        isAdmin: {
            bsonType: 'bool',
            description: 'must be a boolean and is required'
        }
    }
};
```

The schema defines the following constraints:
- The required fields are `name` and `isAdmin`.
- The `name` field must be a string with a minimum length of 5 characters.
- The `isAdmin` field must be a boolean.

## Explore the script to apply the schema

Examine the lines immediately following the schema definition in the `apply-schema.ts` file. You will see a function that applies the schema to the `users` collection.

```js
console.log('Applying schema validation for users...');
const resultUsers = await db.command({
    collMod: 'users',
    validator: {
        $jsonSchema: userSchema
    },
    validationLevel: 'strict',
    validationAction: 'error'
});
```

The function uses the `db.command()` method to apply the schema to the `users` collection.
- The `collMod` option specifies the collection to which the schema should be applied.
- The `validator` option specifies the JSON schema to use for validation. This is the `userSchema` object declared just above.
- The `validationLevel` option specifies the level of validation to perform. This could be `strict` or `moderate`.
    - If you set it to `strict`, the document will be inserted and updated only if it passes validation.
    - If you set it to `moderate` updates to existing documents in the collection that don't match the validation rules aren't checked for validity.
- And finally, the `validationAction` option specifies the action to take when a document fails validation. This could be `error` or `warn`.
    - If you set it to `error`, MongoDB rejects any insert or update that violates the validation criteria.
    - If you set it to `warn`, the operation proceeds, but the violation is recorded in the MongoDB log.

## Apply the schema to the `users` collection

You need to run the script to apply the schema to the `users` collection.

1. Open a new terminal emulator tab in your GitHub Codespace. 
    1. Locate the bottom panel and click on the `TERMINAL` tab.
    1. Locate the `+` icon on the top right of the terminal panel and click on it to open a new terminal tab.
    1. Click on the new terminal tab to activate it.

1. Run the following command to apply the schema to the `users` collection:

    ```sh
    cd server
    npx tsx src/schema-validation/apply-schema.ts

    ```

    You might be prompted to allow pasting into the terminal. Click **Allow** to paste the command.

    Click enter to run the command. After a few of seconds, you should see the following output:

    ```sh
    Connecting to MongoDB Atlas...
    Connected!

    Applying schema validation for users...
    Schema validation enabled!
    ```

:::caution
If you see an error related to your user permissions, go back to the [Database User Permissions](#database-user-permissions) section and update your user permissions.
:::

## Test the schema validation

Now that the schema validation is enabled for the `users` collection, you can test it by inserting a document that does not match the schema.

1. Open the file `server/src/schema-validation/test-validation.ts` [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/main/server/src/schema-validation/test-validation.ts).
2. Explore the `insertOne()` function that will try to insert a new user and the error handling code.
3. Execute the script by running the following command.

  ```sh
  npx tsx src/schema-validation/test-validation.ts
  ```

The error describes that the `name` and `isAdmin` fields are required but missing in the document you tried to insert.

Modify the script to insert a document again with the `name` and `isAdmin` fields and you should see the document inserted successfully.

## Summary

In this exercise, you explored the JSON schema for the `users` collection, ran a script to apply the schema to the collection, and tested the schema validation by inserting a document that does not match the schema.

In the next exercise, you will enable schema validation for the `authors` collection.
