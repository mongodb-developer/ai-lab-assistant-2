# ðŸ“˜ Intro

If you followed this session in person with the MongoDB team, you've learned data modeling concepts and best practices. The data you imported uses the schema presented in the session, but the code samples are querying data as if it were a relational database. In this exercise, you'll update the code to use the data model you learned about in the session.

:::note
If you haven't followed the session with us, we recommend that you go through the [Data Modeling Course](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/data-modeling-for-mongodb) on MongoDB University before attempting this exercise.
