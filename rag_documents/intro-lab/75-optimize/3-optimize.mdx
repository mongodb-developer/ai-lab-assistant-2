# üëê Optimize the query

Now that you know of the patterns that we used in our data schema, you can rewrite the `getBook` method to retrieve the book information.

Open the `server/src/controllers/books.ts` file, and look for the `getBook` method. How could you rewrite this query to be blazing fast, and meet the requirements that we defined for this application?

:::tip
How many calls do you need to do to your database now? Do you still need an aggregation pipeline? Look into the [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.findOne/) for the `findOne` method.
