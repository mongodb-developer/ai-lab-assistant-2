# ℹ️ GitHub Codespaces Issues

#### **Problem:**

Users are experiencing issues with GitHub Codespaces, such as ports (5000, 4200) not being made public.

#### **Common Issues and Solutions:**

### **1\. Ports Not Made Public**

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Check Port Visibility Settings:**
    
    - Open your Codespace.
    - Click on the **Ports** tab in the lower panel.
    - Locate the ports you need to make public (e.g., 5000, 4200).
2. **Make Ports Public:**
    
    - Click on the lock icon next to the port number to change it from private to public.
    - Ensure the status changes to **public**.
3. **Verify Application Configuration:**
    
    - Ensure your application is configured to listen on the correct ports.
    - Check your application’s settings to make sure it’s set to bind to all network interfaces. For example, in a Node.js application:
        
        javascript
        
        Copy code
        
        ``const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
        app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
          console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
        });`` 
        

### **2\. Authentication Issues**

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Check GitHub Authentication:**
    
    - Ensure you are logged into GitHub from your Codespace.
    - Run `gh auth status` to verify authentication status.
    - If not authenticated, run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts to log in.
2. **Access Permissions:**
    
    - Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the repository.
    - Check if you are part of the correct team or organization that owns the repository.

### **3\. Environment Setup Problems**

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Check Devcontainer Configuration:**
    
    - Ensure your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file is correctly configured.
    - Example configuration:
        
        json
        
        Copy code
        
        `{
          "name": "My Codespace",
          "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:0-focal",
          "features": {
            "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker:1": {}
          },
          "forwardPorts": [5000, 4200]
        }` 
        
2. **Rebuild Codespace:**
    
    - Sometimes rebuilding the Codespace can resolve setup issues.
    - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), search for `Codespaces: Rebuild Container`, and select it.

### **4\. Slow or Unresponsive Codespace**

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Monitor Resource Usage:**
    
    - Check the resource usage of your Codespace.
    - Open the terminal and use commands like `top` or `htop` to monitor CPU and memory usage.
2. **Adjust Machine Type:**
    
    - If your Codespace is consistently slow, consider upgrading to a more powerful machine type.
    - You can do this from the Codespace configuration settings on GitHub.

### **5\. Errors During Application Startup**

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Review Logs:**
    
    - Check the application logs for errors.
    - Open the terminal in your Codespace and review the output of your application’s startup command.
2. **Common Errors and Fixes:**
    
    - **Port Already in Use:**
        - Ensure no other processes are using the required ports.
        - Use `lsof -i :5000` or `lsof -i :4200` to check for processes using these ports and kill them if necessary.
    - **Missing Environment Variables:**
        - Ensure all necessary environment variables are set.
        - Add them to your `.env` file or set them directly in the Codespace settings.
