# üëê MongoDB Database

As we'll be importing data from a Relational Database into MongoDB, you'll need to have a MongoDB database. You have a 
few options to set up this database.

## üëê Option 1: New MongoDB Atlas cluster

The easiest way to run MongoDB is to use MongoDB Atlas, our cloud-hosted database offering.
You can set a MongoDB Atlas account and a free forever M0 Cluster.

To get yours, follow the instructions on the [Intro Lab:](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/what-is-mongodb)
- [Create your Account](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/create-account)
- [Deploy a Database Cluster](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/create-cluster)

Be sure to [open up the cluster to allow connections from your local computer](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/network-connections/#overview), and configure a database user with the readWriteAnyDatabase role.

## ü¶∏ Option 2: Use an existing cluster

If you have an existing MongoDB Atlas, Enterprise or Community cluster, you can use it as the migration target. Make sure you
know the URI for the cluster, and have a database user with the readWriteAnyDatabase role. 

## ü¶∏ Option 3: Run a MongoDB container using Docker


If you don't have an existing MongoDB server but have Docker installed, you can easily load a container pre-configured with 
MongoDB by running the following command:

```
docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

This will launch an empty MongoDB community cluster on localhost:27017, suitable to use for this lab. 
You can connect with no username or password. Since this command does not use Docker volumes, any data will be lost when the container is stopped.
