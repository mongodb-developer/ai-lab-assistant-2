# üëê Generate app code

The Relational Migrator allows you to generate application code in a variety of languages, derived from your MongoDB schema definition.
While this code is not a full-blown app, it can save developers significant time compared to creating entity classes by hand. 

- At the top, switch to Code Generation tab
- Under Language, select `C#` (or your preferred language)
- Under Template, select `Persistence Layer`
- Click each of the collections in the list. Notice the tabs containing entity classes and CRUD helpers for each collection or embedded object.
- Under Language, select `JSON'
- Under Template, select `Sample Documents`. Notice how you can view examples of how data in each collection will be structured.
- Under Template, select `JSON Schema (MongoDB)`. Notice how you can view and download JSON [Schema validators](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/category/schema-validation) which could be used to enforce schema compliance.
