# üëê Convert SQL queries

Relational Migrator can help convert SQL queries to MongoDB Query Language, wrapped 
in your choice of programming langauge. This feature uses Artifical Intelligence and requires an <Link to="http://mongodb.com/try">Atlas account</Link> and internet connectivity.

- At the top, switch to Code Generation tab
- Click Query Converter
- Sign into your MongoDB Atlas account
- Accept the Query Converter licence terms
- Click `Paste SQL query`
- In the empty query, type `SELECT * FROM books WHERE "bookOfTheMonth" = true AND pages > 500` 
- Leave the language as JavaScript and click Convert. 

After a while, the equivalent MongoDB query will be shown at the right of the page.
