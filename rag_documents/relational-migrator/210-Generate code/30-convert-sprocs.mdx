# üëê Convert Views and Stored Procedures

Relational Migrator can import and convert views and stored procedures to MongoDB Query Language, wrapped 
in your choice of programming langauge. This feature uses Artifical Intelligence and requires an Atlas account and internet connectivity.

- If needed, open Query Converter and sign in with your Atlas account.
- Click on the `Add` button, the `Import from database`.
- Check all Views and Stored Procedures and click `Save`.
- Click one of the imported views or stored procedures
- Select your preferred programming language and click Convert. 

After a while, the equivalent MongoDB query will be shown at the right of the page. Try some other queries and langauges!
