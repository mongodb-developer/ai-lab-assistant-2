# üëê Run a Continuous Migration Job

Relational Migrator allows you to use Change-Data-Capture processes to continously synchronize data in your MongoDB database with changes made in your source database.
When a continous migration is requested, Relational Migrator will first complete a normal full synchronization before entering Chane Data Capture mode.
Change Data Capture synchronization will continue until you explicitly complete it. 

To start a continuous migration job, switch to Data Migration tab:
