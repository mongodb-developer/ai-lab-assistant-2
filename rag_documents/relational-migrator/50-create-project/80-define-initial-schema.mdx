# üëê Define the Initial Schema

Relational Migrator gives you three options on how your MongoDB schema should be created. Regardless of which option you choose, you can manually modify your schema later. 

Select `Start with a recommended MongoDB schema`

You are asked which tables should represented as a collection in MongoDB. 

Select the following six collections as they are the main entities in our schema:

- authors
- books
- languages
- operations
- reviews
- users

Any tables you did not check will be embedded in other collections.

Select the casing you'd like for your collections - the default is camelCase.

Click `Next`, then give your project a name.
