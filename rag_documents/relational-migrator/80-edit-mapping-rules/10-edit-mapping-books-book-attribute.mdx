# üëê Clean up book attributes  


We want to clean up the bookAttributes array in our MongoDB schema. We want an array of objects containing attributes, modelled as key value pairs. something like:

```json
{
    "_id": 838383, // book id
    "attributes": [
        {
            "key": "price",
            "value": 11
        },
        {
            "key": "pages",
            "value": 236
        },
        // ...
    ] 
}
```

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click on the `books` collection.
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `book_attribute` embedded array mapping rule.
- Change the Field name from `bookAttributes` to `attributes`.
- Uncheck `bookId`. We just want all the attributes, which are key/value pairs. Also, as we're embedded inside books, we don't need the `bookId` anymore.
- Click `Save and close`.

Here we've implemented the [Attribute Pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/attribute-pattern/) for MongoDB. This will allow for easy indexing, querying based on attributes and extension of attributes.
