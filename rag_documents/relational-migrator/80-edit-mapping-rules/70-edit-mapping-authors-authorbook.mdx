# ðŸ¦¸ Simplify the books array in the authors collection

:::info
Extra activity! Do it if you have extra time or are following along at home. It won't be covered during the hands-on lab.
:::

We want to modify the authors collection so the array of books include just the `bookId`. 

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `authors` collection.
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `author_book`.
- Edit the field name from `authorBooks` to just `books`.
- In the list of fields, uncheck `authorId`, leaving `bookId` checked.
- In the mapping rule's advanced settings, Check `create array of primitive values`.
- Click `Save and close`.
